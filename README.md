# Hello, I'm Lance! 👋

I'm a fourth-year student at the University of Toronto with a passion for technology, software development, and development. With a computer science background and a strong software engineering foundation, I'm on a journey to make a meaningful impact through code and innovation.

**Note: I had access to private Github accounts during my internships, and thus these accounts/contributions are not all public.**
