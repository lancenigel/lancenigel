# Hi, I'm Lance! 👋

Welcome to my page! I'm currently in my fourth year at the University of Toronto, deeply immersed in the realms of technology and software development. My journey is fueled by a blend of computer science knowledge and a robust foundation in software engineering. I'm driven by the ambition to create a significant impact in the world through innovative coding practices.


## Previous Experience

### Karpool (Summer 2023)
• Utilized React Native, MongoDB, and Node.js within an Azure ecosystem for end-to-end full-stack development.

• Pioneered the integration of the Stripe API, which reduced payment processing times by 25% and improved transaction success rates by 30%. This enhancement was pivotal in elevating the app's functionality.

• Handled comprehensive responsibilities from front-end aesthetics to back-end structuring, including database management and deployment on Azure.

### Global Spark (Winter 2023)
• Led the creation and implementation of responsive web applications with cutting-edge front-end tools, markedly boosting user interaction.

• Worked collaboratively in a multicultural team setting to craft and execute user-friendly interfaces, enhancing both user experience and accessibility.
